# DIY Robots Car

Welcome to the DIY Robots Car repository! This project collection features Arduino-based robotic car projects including a Bluetooth-controlled car and an IR sensor robot car. These projects are perfect for beginners and hobbyists interested in robotics, wireless control, and sensor integration.

## Projects Included
- **DIY Bluetooth Control Car**  
  Control your robot car wirelessly using a Bluetooth module and Arduino. Learn how to assemble the chassis, connect motors with an L298N motor driver, and interface the HC-05 Bluetooth module for smartphone control.

- **IR Sensor Robot Car**  
  Build a robot car that can detect and respond to obstacles using infrared sensors. This project demonstrates sensor integration and autonomous navigation basics.

## Features
- Easy-to-follow Arduino code for motor control and sensor handling
- Step-by-step hardware wiring and assembly instructions
- Wireless control using Bluetooth communication
- Obstacle detection with IR sensors for autonomous movement

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the code from the respective project folder.
3. Connect your hardware components as per the wiring diagrams.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
5. Pair the Bluetooth module with your smartphone (for Bluetooth car).
6. Test and enjoy your DIY robotic car!

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- L298N motor driver module
- HC-05 Bluetooth module (for Bluetooth control car)
- IR sensors (for IR sensor robot car)
- 2WD smart car chassis kit with motors
- Jumper wires and power supply
